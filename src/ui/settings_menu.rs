//! # System Settings and Configuration Interface
//!
//! This module provides system-level configuration management for the OpenController
//! application, focusing on network connectivity and display settings crucial for
//! embedded and Single Board Computer (SBC) deployments.
//!
//! ## Why This Module Exists
//!
//! The Settings module addresses a critical requirement for OpenController's vision
//! as a unified control system for Smart Home and Maker applications: reliable
//! configuration management for headless and embedded deployments.
//!
//! The module exists primarily to solve these deployment scenarios:
//! - **Raspberry Pi Deployments**: Managing WiFi connectivity without external keyboards
//! - **Workshop Environments**: Adjusting display settings for varying lighting conditions
//! - **Headless Operation**: Configuring network settings through the primary interface
//! - **Multi-Environment Usage**: Adapting display and network settings for different locations
//!
//! ## Key Abstractions
//!
//! ### Network Management for Embedded Systems
//! WiFi configuration is particularly critical for OpenController because:
//! - The application targets Single Board Computer deployments
//! - Network connectivity affects remote access and MQTT functionality
//! - Gamepad-based configuration provides input method independence
//! - Visual network status supports troubleshooting in workshop environments
//!
//! ### Display Configuration for Workshop Use
//! Display settings address the specific usage patterns of maker/workshop environments:
//! - Variable lighting conditions requiring brightness adjustment
//! - Power management for battery-powered deployments
//! - Screensaver functionality for unattended operation
//!
//! ## Design Rationale
//!
//! ### Two-Section Layout Architecture
//! The settings interface is organized into distinct functional areas:
//! - **WLAN Section**: Network connectivity management with immediate status feedback
//! - **Display Section**: Visual and power management settings
//!
//! This separation reflects the different update frequencies and criticality of these
//! configuration areas - network settings change infrequently but are critical for
//! operation, while display settings may be adjusted frequently based on environment.
//!
//! ### Responsive Layout System
//! Uses calculated width distribution rather than fixed dimensions to ensure:
//! - Consistent appearance across different display sizes
//! - Optimal use of available screen real estate
//! - Gamepad-friendly interaction targets
//! - Visual balance between input fields and controls
//!
//! ## Integration with Backend Systems
//!
//! ### Current Implementation Status
//! **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: This module currently uses mock data and simulated functionality.
//! The UI layout and interaction patterns are finalized, but backend integration
//! is pending implementation.
//!
//! ### Planned Backend Integration
//! When fully implemented, this module will integrate with:
//! - **System Network Manager**: Direct WiFi configuration on Linux systems
//! - **ConfigPortal**: Persistent storage of network and display preferences
//! - **Session Management**: Per-session display and network profiles
//! - **Hardware Interfaces**: Direct brightness control and power management
//!
//! ## Future Extension Points
//!
//! The module is designed for expansion to support additional system settings:
//! - Audio configuration for notification sounds
//! - Input device management (additional controllers)
//! - Regional settings (timezone, language)
//! - Advanced network settings (static IP, proxy configuration)
//! - Hardware-specific settings (GPIO configuration, sensor calibration)

/// Main data structure for system settings and configuration management.
///
/// This structure manages both network connectivity settings (critical for SBC
/// deployments) and display configuration (essential for workshop environments).
/// Currently implements mock functionality while establishing the UI patterns
/// for future backend integration.
///
/// ## Design Rationale
/// Combines network and display settings in a single structure because they
/// represent the core system-level configurations that users need immediate
/// access to, particularly in embedded deployment scenarios.
///
/// ## Network Management Strategy
/// Maintains both current and selected network state to support:
/// - Visual indication of current connectivity status
/// - Network switching workflows without connection loss
/// - Password management for secure network access
/// - Connection state feedback for troubleshooting
///
/// ## Display Configuration Approach
/// Uses floating-point values for brightness and integer values for timing
/// to match underlying system interfaces while providing intuitive UI controls.
///
/// ## Mock Data vs. Production
/// Current implementation uses mock data to establish UI patterns. Production
/// implementation will replace mock data with actual system integration while
/// maintaining the same user interaction model.

    ///
    /// ## Design Rationale
    ///
    /// ### Three-Column Layout
    /// Uses calculated width distribution to balance functionality:
    /// - **Network Selection (45%)**: ComboBox for available networks
    /// - **Password Entry (45%)**: Secure text input for authentication  
    /// - **Connection Control (10%)**: Connect button for action triggering
    ///
    /// This distribution prioritizes the primary workflow elements while maintaining
    /// visual balance and touch-friendly interaction targets.
    ///
    /// ### Connection Workflow
    /// Implements a typical WiFi connection sequence:
    /// 1. Display current network status
    /// 2. Select target network from available list
    /// 3. Enter authentication credentials
    /// 4. Trigger connection attempt
    /// 5. Update status display
    ///
    /// ## Network Security Handling
    /// Uses password-masked text input to protect credentials during entry
    /// while maintaining usability for gamepad-based text input.
    ///
    /// ## Future Implementation Notes
    /// TODO comments indicate where actual system integration will replace
    /// current mock functionality:
    /// - Network scanning and discovery
    /// - Actual WiFi connection management
    /// - Connection status monitoring
    /// - Error handling and user feedback

    /// allowing both quick adjustment and precise timing configuration.
    /// Range supports both immediate screensaver (0) and extended operation (1 hour).
    ///
    /// ## Workshop Environment Considerations
    /// These settings address common workshop and embedded usage patterns:
    /// - Brightness adjustment for varying ambient lighting
    /// - Power management for battery-powered deployments
    /// - Automatic display management for unattended operation
    ///
    /// ## Future Implementation Notes

    /// will integrate with:
    /// - System brightness control interfaces
    /// - Power management subsystems
    /// - Hardware-specific display controllers
